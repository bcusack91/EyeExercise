# EyeExercise

<b>Title of the project:</b> Eye Exercise <br>
<b>Description of the project:</b> In this project, we utilized a for loop to demonstrate 2 eyes moving as they follow the cursor around the screen.  The eyes consist of 2 white slits with pupils inside of them that track the position of the mouse and move to the respective corner of the eye to simulate movement.<br>
<b>How to Run:</b> Simply load the page and watch the eyes creepily follow your cursor around the screen! <br>
<b>Roadmap of future improvements:</b> Perhaps adding in some 3D capabilities where the eyes are part of a head that can move turn to simulate a 3D change.
